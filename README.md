# Lung Adenocarcinoma Mutation Analysis

This project explores mutation data for lung adenocarcinoma obtained from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC).  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to better understand mutation patterns.

## Data

- The data comes from [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)
- Due to licensing restrictions, the raw data file (`cosmic_genes_with_mutation.csv`) **is not included** in this repository.
- You can obtain the data by registering on COSMIC and downloading the relevant dataset, then placing it in the `lung_data/` folder.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the COSMIC lung adenocarcinoma mutation data and place the CSV file in the `lung_data/` directory.
3. Install required Python packages
